## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

The global telecom market is massive and is expected to grow. According to Globe News Wire, the market value of the telecom industry was $1.73 trillion in 2021. 

Furthermore, the future is promising since the market is expected to grow to $2.65 trillion by 2030. Customers use their phone not just for calling others but also for paying bills, studying, watching television, and anything else you can think of. Our phones hold the keys to our lives. Any business that provides phone service finds themselves sitting under a goldmine. If SyriaTel is looking to expand their reach in the American market or just keep its current position then it needs to undertand the business landscape and its customers.

Competition is fierce since the American market contain giants like Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast. So, if you are looking to increase your foothold in the United States or maintain your place then you have to focus on customer churn.
Today, I will provide insights and recommendations that will increase customer retention and reduce customer churn.

## DATA UNDERSTANDING

Customer churn is when a customer leaves the company and retention is when a customer continues using the company’s service. SyriaTel’s churn rate is only 14.5% compared to the industry average of 22%. I used a dataset of over 3,000 American customers. I wanted to know what factors are most important in determining customer churn and how churn can be reduced. **The metric I will optimize is the F1 score**. Both precision and recall are very important for this project so F1 is best used because it is a combination of both precision and recall.
